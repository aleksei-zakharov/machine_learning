# Machine Learning

The repo focuses on machine learning topics:

* ***1 layer NN with 128 nodes recognizes handwritten digits.ipynb*** file is dedicated to shallow neural network training to recognize handwritten digits in MNIST dataset.

* ***Approximate sin5x with shallow NN.ipynb*** shows how shallow neural network with 150 nodes can efficiently approximate sin(5x) function on a bounded interval. This file clearly demonstrates the corollary of the Universal Approximation Theorem.
